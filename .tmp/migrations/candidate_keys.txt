github.com/WebRenew/memories|decision|Decision: expose /graph/status with node_count edge_count expired_edge_count and last_indexed_at for dashboard observability
github.com/WebRenew/memories|decision|Decision: shadow metrics should run on every query when rollout mode is canary to compare hybrid vs baseline
github.com/WebRenew/memories|decision|Graph explorer should default to top connected node and allow hopping across adjacent edges.
github.com/WebRenew/memories|decision|Graph retrieval depth should stay at 1 by default to cap noise and keep recall explainability clear.
github.com/WebRenew/memories|decision|Schema initialization should be best-effort; read paths must remain available when migration writes fail.
github.com/WebRenew/memories|fact|Fact: memory graph explorer needs node degree filters and recent error stream for operator debugging
github.com/WebRenew/memories|fact|Fact: top nodes card should aggregate by edge participation over trailing 24h for quick hotspot detection
github.com/WebRenew/memories|fact|Graph smoke test memory: workspace-level hybrid_graph toggle should control retrieval mode without changing API schema
github.com/WebRenew/memories|fact|Graph trace payloads must include requested strategy, applied strategy, rollout mode, and fallback reason.
github.com/WebRenew/memories|fact|Rollout mode canary requires requests to ask strategy hybrid_graph; otherwise baseline remains applied.
github.com/WebRenew/memories|note|Note: dashboard empty state should surface schema mismatch guidance and link to graph migration endpoint
github.com/WebRenew/memories|note|Top nodes panel should emphasize repo, category, and topic node relationships for debugging traversal quality.
github.com/WebRenew/memories|note|Use /api/graph/explore for node neighborhood introspection including edges and linked memory evidence.
github.com/WebRenew/memories|rule|Keep graph alarm text concise and actionable so on-call can decide between canary and shadow quickly.
github.com/WebRenew/memories|rule|Memory graph dashboard should surface rollout mode, fallback rate, and alarm severity before node details.
github.com/WebRenew/memories|rule|Rule: if graph query fails, safe fallback must return baseline semantic recall and emit alarm event
github.com/WebRenew/memories|rule|Rule: recall trace payload must include mode selected_sources latency_ms and fallback_reason for every retrieval
github.com/WebRenew/memories|rule|Rule: workspace setting hybrid_graph=true is the full switch for always-on hybrid retrieval
github.com/WebRenew/memories|rule|When fallback rate exceeds 15 percent over 24h, treat as critical and degrade to shadow mode.
