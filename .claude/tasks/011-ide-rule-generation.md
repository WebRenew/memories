# Task: Generate IDE Rules from Memories

## Priority: Integration

## Description
Generate Cursor rules (`.cursor/rules/`) and Claude Code (`CLAUDE.md`) files from memories. This bridges memories with IDE-native AI context systems.

## Why It Matters
- Many users already use Cursor rules / CLAUDE.md
- Memories can be the single source of truth
- Auto-generate IDE files from memories
- Keep IDE rules in sync with team memories

## Implementation Steps

- [ ] Create `memories generate` command with subcommands
- [ ] `memories generate cursor`:
  - Output rules to `.cursor/rules/memories.mdc`
  - Use Cursor's MDC format with frontmatter
  - Support `--output <path>` for custom location
- [ ] `memories generate claude`:
  - Output rules to `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`
  - Format as markdown with sections
- [ ] Support `--watch` flag to regenerate on changes
- [ ] Include metadata comments for sync tracking
- [ ] Add `--types` flag to filter (e.g., only rules)

## Example Output - Cursor

```markdown
---
description: Project rules from memories.sh
globs: ["**/*"]
---

# Project Rules

- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Handle all errors explicitly with try/catch
- Use Tailwind for all styling

# Key Decisions

- Chose PostgreSQL for JSONB support
- Using FTS5 for full-text search

## Example Output - Claude

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

## Rules

- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Handle all errors explicitly with try/catch

## Context

### Decisions
- Chose PostgreSQL for JSONB support

### Facts  
- API rate limit is 100 requests/minute

```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `memories generate cursor` creates valid Cursor rules
- [ ] `memories generate claude` creates valid CLAUDE.md
- [ ] `--watch` regenerates on memory changes
- [ ] Generated files include source attribution
- [ ] Custom output paths supported
