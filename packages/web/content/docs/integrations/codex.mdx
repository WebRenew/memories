description: Integrate memories.sh with OpenAI Codex CLI.
---

[Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) is OpenAI's CLI coding agent. It reads instructions from `AGENTS.md` and the `.agents/` directory.

## Quick Setup

```bash
cd your-project
memories init
```

This automatically:
1. Sets up your local memory store
2. Configures MCP for supported tools
3. Generates instruction files with your existing memories

## Manual Setup

### Option 1: Generated File

```bash
memories generate agents
```

This creates the canonical `.agents/` directory that Codex reads for project context. Codex also reads `AGENTS.md` at the project root.

### Option 2: MCP Server

Codex has built-in MCP support. Configure it to use memories.sh:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@memories.sh/cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Recommended: Use Both

1. **Generated file** — Provides instructions Codex always sees via `AGENTS.md`
2. **MCP server** — Gives Codex live access to search, recall, and add memories

## Syncing Codex Config

To sync your Codex configuration across machines:

```bash
# On your main machine
memories files ingest

# On a new machine
memories files apply --global --force
```
