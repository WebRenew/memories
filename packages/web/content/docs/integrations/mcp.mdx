title: MCP Server
description: Use memories.sh with any MCP-compatible client.
---

memories.sh includes a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes your memories directly to any compatible AI agent or client.

## Starting the Server

```bash
memories serve
```

This starts an MCP server that provides tools for reading, writing, and searching memories.

## Available Tools

The MCP server exposes these tools to connected clients:

- **memories_add** - Add a new memory with optional tags and type
- **memories_list** - List all memories, optionally filtered by tags or type
- **memories_search** - Full-text search across memory content
- **memories_recall** - Get contextually relevant memories for a given prompt
- **memories_delete** - Remove a memory by ID

## Client Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "memories",
