description: Integrate memories.sh with Amp by Sourcegraph.
---

[Amp](https://amp.dev/) is Sourcegraph's coding agent. It reads rules from `.amp/rules/` and supports MCP servers for extended tool access.

## Quick Setup

```bash
cd your-project
memories init
```

This automatically:
1. Sets up your local memory store
2. Configures MCP for supported tools
3. Generates instruction files with your existing memories

## Manual Setup

### Option 1: Generated File

```bash
memories generate agents
```

This creates the canonical `.agents/` directory that Amp reads for project context.

### Option 2: MCP Server

Add memories.sh to Amp's MCP configuration. Create or edit `.amp/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@memories.sh/cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Recommended: Use Both

1. **Generated file** — Provides instructions Amp always sees
2. **MCP server** — Gives Amp live access to search, recall, and add memories

## Syncing Amp Config

To sync your Amp configuration across machines:

```bash
# On your main machine
memories files ingest

# On a new machine
memories files apply --global --force
```
