description: Integrate memories.sh with Openclaw.
---

[Openclaw](https://openclaw.ai/) is an open-source personal AI agent by Peter Steinberger. It features persistent memory, extensible skill plugins, browser automation, and 50+ integrations across chat platforms, developer tools, and smart home devices.

## Why memories.sh + Openclaw

Openclaw has its own built-in memory system. Adding memories.sh gives you:

- **Cross-tool portability** — Memories created in Openclaw are available in Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, and every other integration
- **Structured storage** — Rules, decisions, and facts with full-text search (FTS5)
- **Project scoping** — Path-scoped rules that activate only in relevant directories

## Quick Setup

```bash
cd your-project
memories init
```

This automatically:
1. Sets up your local memory store
2. Configures MCP for supported tools
3. Generates instruction files with your existing memories

## Manual Setup

### Option 1: Generated File

```bash
memories generate agents
```

This creates the canonical `.agents/` directory that Openclaw reads for project context.

### Option 2: MCP Server

Add memories.sh to Openclaw's MCP configuration. Create or edit `.openclaw/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@memories.sh/cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Recommended: Use Both

1. **Generated file** — Provides a static baseline always available to Openclaw
2. **MCP server** — Gives Openclaw live access to search, recall, and add memories

## Syncing Openclaw Config

To sync your Openclaw configuration across machines:

```bash
# On your main machine
memories files ingest

# On a new machine
memories files apply --global --force
```
