description: Integrate memories.sh with Goose by Block.
---

[Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) is Block's open-source AI agent. It reads rules from `.goose/rules/` and supports MCP servers for extended capabilities.

## Quick Setup

```bash
cd your-project
memories init
```

This automatically:
1. Sets up your local memory store
2. Configures MCP for supported tools
3. Generates instruction files with your existing memories

## Manual Setup

### Option 1: Generated File

```bash
memories generate agents
```

This creates the canonical `.agents/` directory that Goose reads for project context.

### Option 2: MCP Server

Goose has built-in MCP support. Add memories.sh through Goose's configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memories": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@memories.sh/cli", "serve"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Recommended: Use Both

1. **Generated file** — Provides instructions Goose always sees
2. **MCP server** — Gives Goose live access to search, recall, and add memories

## Syncing Goose Config

To sync your Goose configuration across machines:

```bash
# On your main machine
memories files ingest

# On a new machine
memories files apply --global --force
```
