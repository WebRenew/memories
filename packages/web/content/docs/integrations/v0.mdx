[v0](https://v0.dev/) is Vercel's AI-powered tool for generating React components and UI. Since v0 is a web app focused on UI generation (not a full coding agent), it doesn't have MCP client support. However, you can still use your memories.sh context with v0.

## Using Memories with v0

### Export Context and Paste

The recommended approach is to export your relevant memories and include them in your v0 prompt:

```bash
# Generate a context prompt with your rules
memories prompt > context.md

# Or search for specific relevant memories
memories search "react components" 
memories search "tailwind" --type rule
```

Then include the context in your v0 prompt:

```
My coding standards:
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Use Tailwind CSS with cn() helper for conditional classes  
- Prefer shadcn/ui components
- Use React Server Components by default

Build me a dashboard card component that shows user stats...
```

### Generate a Context File

Create a dedicated context file you can reference:

```bash
memories prompt --types rule,decision > v0-context.md
```

Keep this file open alongside v0 and copy relevant sections as needed.

## Best Practices

### 1. Keep context focused

v0 works best with concise, focused context. Don't dump all your memories — pick the relevant ones:

```bash
# Search for UI-related rules
memories search "component" --type rule
memories search "styling" --type rule
memories search "tailwind"
```

### 2. Include your design system rules

If you have rules about your design system, include them:

```bash
memories search "design" --type rule
memories search "shadcn" 
```

### 3. Save v0's patterns back to memories

After v0 generates something you like, save the patterns:

```bash
memories add --rule "Use Tailwind's cn() helper for conditional classes"
memories add --rule "Card components use rounded-lg shadow-sm border"
memories add --decision "Chose shadcn/ui Card for all card-style containers"
```

These will be available for your next v0 session and all your other AI tools.

## Why No Direct MCP?

v0 is different from coding agents like Cursor or Claude Code:

| Tool | Type | MCP Support |
|------|------|-------------|
| Cursor, Claude Code | Full coding agents | Yes (stdio) |
| v0 | UI generation tool | No |

v0 runs entirely in your browser and is optimized for quick UI generation, not long-running agent sessions with tool access.

## Future: Web-Based MCP

For web-based AI tools that *do* support MCP (like future coding agents), memories.sh will support SSE (Server-Sent Events) transport:

```bash
# Planned feature
memories serve --sse --port 3030
```

This would require:
1. **Exposing the server** via tunnel (ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel)
2. **Authentication** to protect your memories (API key or token)

For now, the copy-paste workflow is the most practical approach for v0.

## Quick Reference

```bash
# Export all rules for v0
memories prompt --types rule > v0-rules.md

# Search for specific context
memories search "react" --type rule
memories search "component patterns" --semantic

# Save patterns from v0
memories add --rule "Your new rule from v0"
```
